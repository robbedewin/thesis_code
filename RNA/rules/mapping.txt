The Snakemake rules crafted above integrate the key aspects of RNA-Seq analysis
pertinent to the research focus on T-ALL induction failure:
•	General Gene Expression Analysis:
 This step is foundational, as it facilitates a broad understanding of gene expression patterns within T-ALL samples. 
 By employing STAR for alignment, we capture a comprehensive snapshot of the transcriptomic landscape, 
 essential for elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets.
•	Fusion Gene Detection:
 The utilization of STAR-Fusion underscores our targeted approach to identifying fusion genes, 
 which are significant contributors to the oncogenic processes in T-ALL. 
 Fusion genes can serve as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, 
 highlighting their importance in precision medicine strategies for treating induction failure in T-ALL.
 
This dual analytical strategy enables a holistic exploration of the genetic underpinnings associated with T-ALL induction failure, facilitating the discovery of novel insights and potential interventions that could improve patient outcomes.
